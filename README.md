# Pymaceuticals - A Plotting Challenge

- This repository contains data and analysis for an exercise in Python to assess a trial for tumor-reducing drugs in mice.
- The main analysis is contained in the Jupyter notebook, pymaceuticals-mj.jpynb. The written analysis is at the top of the notebook; the supporting code below.
- The graphs from the Jupyter notebook are contained in the output folder, but the graphics are also visible in the written analysis within the notebook.
- Code was written by me, with a little help on specific functions from Xpert Learning Assistant. I didn't use entire blocks of code from it, only the bits I didn't quite have to get the results I was expecting.
